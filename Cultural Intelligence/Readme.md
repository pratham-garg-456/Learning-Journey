### Welcome to our Learning-Journey:  Cultural Intelligence

Each week, I'll be sharing key insights and reflections from my experiences from Cultural Intelligence Course (CIN 100). My goal is not just to document my own progress but to create a space where we can all learn together, challenge assumptions, and build more culturally aware perspectives. I hope these reflections spark meaningful conversations and encourage others to step out of their comfort zones.

**Keep in mind:**
🌱 Stepping out of your comfort zone is essential for growth. Moving into the learning zone brings valuable experiences, but too much discomfort can be overwhelming. It’s important to stay open to discomfort while recognizing when it's too much.

Throughout my journey in learning about cultural intelligence, I've realized how much of our behaviour is shaped by **unconscious socialization**. 
From how we're taught to behave at the dinner table by our parents and elders to the subtle ways we perceive the world, many aspects of socialization happen without us thinking much about it.

🧠 **Ethnocentric** attitudes can hide in everyday conversations, advertising, curriculum, and even laws. 
For example, instead of saying, *“Hebrew and Arabic are written backwards,”* it’s more inclusive to say, *“Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left.”* Small shifts in phrasing make a big difference.

✨ **Biases:** I’ve been reflecting on moments when I thought the way I do things is right, and the way others do them is wrong. Social media shaped my initial impression of Natto as unpleasant. Instead of saying *"Natto tastes stinky,"* a more respectful way would be, *"Natto has a strong, unique flavour and aroma that some appreciate, while others might find it unfamiliar."*

👥 When attending networking events, people often ask me, *“Where in India are you from?”* That question made me uncomfortable even though I am from India. But now I realize it’s an opportunity to address biases. Instead of just stating my state/province, I’ll respond, *“Yes, I’m from India and from this state/province, but it’s always a good idea to ask others more openly. People's backgrounds can be diverse, and assumptions can sometimes feel limiting or uncomfortable for others"*.

> ### 'It's part of being human to pick up on differences'

💡 It’s 100% A-Okay to make mistakes. The important part is recognizing them and actively working to update both conscious and unconscious beliefs. 

If you witness discrimination, stereotyping, or microaggressions, try to say something, even if it is to someone you love, whether to someone else or even to yourself.

In the end, we are all human, picking up on differences. Let’s continue learning and growing together.
